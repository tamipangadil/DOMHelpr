# DOMHelpr
DOMHelpr is mainly used to manage usual tasks when manipulating elements in your HTML.

The main objective is to eliminate basic coding that developer normally do when building their pages.

The concept is so simple. You just need to give instructions to your DOM elements through data parameter in your element. See example below.

```
<div data-helpmydom="add .test after 3s"></div>
```

It tells you that you want to add class "test" after 3 seconds. Pretty simple, right?

We will try to continue developing this and hopefully we will come up with a stable version and release it on any javascript package manager.

## Milestones
1. Add .class or #id
2. Add delay
   - after
3. Add addons
   -  animate.css
4. Add events
   - show
   - hide
   - click
